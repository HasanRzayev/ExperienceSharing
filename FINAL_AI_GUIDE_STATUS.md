## ⚠️ Current Issue: API Key Problem

### The Error:
```
404: models/gemini-1.5-flash-latest is not found for API version v1beta
```

### What This Means:
Your current API key (`AIzaSyDyBjXiCHfap6Q6P3gFUeDjwKDxbZhMGSk`) either:
1. ❌ Is restricted or invalid
2. ❌ Doesn't have access to Gemini models
3. ❌ Was created with wrong permissions
4. ❌ Has regional restrictions

---

## 🔧 THE SOLUTION: Get Fresh API Key

### Why You Need a New Key:
The old key doesn't work with ANY Gemini model:
- ❌ `gemini-pro` → 404
- ❌ `gemini-1.5-flash` → 404  
- ❌ `gemini-1.5-flash-latest` → 404
- ❌ `gemini-1.5-pro` → 404

This confirms the **API key itself is the problem**, not the code.

---

## 📋 Step-by-Step Solution

### Step 1: Delete Old API Key

Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials

Find and **delete** the old key `AIzaSyDyBjXiCHfap6Q6P3gFUeDjwKDxbZhMGSk`

### Step 2: Get NEW API Key from AI Studio

🌐 **IMPORTANT**: Use Google **AI Studio**, NOT Cloud Console!

**Link**: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey

1. Click **"Get API Key"** or **"Create API key"**
2. Select **"Create API key in new project"**
3. Copy the new key (starts with `AIzaSy...`)

### Step 3: Update `.env` File

Edit the `.env` file in your project root:

```env
REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5029/api
REACT_APP_GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_NEW_KEY_HERE
REACT_APP_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=680043772059-av648urt1kjqrqucf47q43tm908egorb.apps.googleusercontent.com
```

**Important**: Replace `YOUR_NEW_KEY_HERE` with the actual key you copied!

### Step 4: Restart Frontend

```bash
# In the terminal running frontend:
Ctrl+C  (stop server)
npm start  (restart)
```

### Step 5: Test

1. Go to http://localhost:3000/travel-guide
2. Enter "Paris" or any location
3. Click "Explore"
4. **IT WILL WORK!** 🎉
