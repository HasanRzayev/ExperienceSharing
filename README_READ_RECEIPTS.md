# Read Receipts Implementation

## Summary
Implemented message read receipts functionality for the chat system. Users can now see when their messages are sent, delivered, and read.

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes

#### 1. Message Model (`ExperienceProject/Models/Message.cs`)
- Added `IsDelivered` (bool) - Indicates if message was delivered to recipient
- Added `IsRead` (bool) - Indicates if message was read by recipient
- Added `ReadAt` (DateTime?) - Timestamp when message was read

#### 2. MessageDTO (`ExperienceProject/Dto/MessageDto.cs`)
- Added `IsDelivered`, `IsRead`, and `ReadAt` fields to DTO

#### 3. MessageHub (`ExperienceProject/Hubs/MessageHub.cs`)
- **Updated SendMessage method**: 
  - Sets `IsDelivered = true` when receiver is online
  - Automatically marks messages as delivered when receiver is connected
- **Added MarkMessagesAsRead method**: 
  - Marks all unread messages from a sender as read
  - Notifies sender via SignalR
- **Added MarkMessageAsRead method**: 
  - Marks a single message as read
  - Notifies sender via SignalR
- **Added MarkConversationAsDelivered method**: 
  - Marks all undelivered messages in a conversation as delivered

#### 4. MessageController (`ExperienceProject/Controllers/MessageController.cs`)
- Updated `GetConversation` endpoint to include:
  - `IsDelivered`
  - `IsRead`
  - `ReadAt`
  - `IsFromCurrentUser` (helper field)
- Updated `SendMessage` endpoint to set initial values for read receipt fields

#### 5. Database Migration (`ADD_READ_RECEIPTS_MIGRATION.sql`)
- SQL script to add new columns to Messages table
- Mark existing messages as delivered

### Frontend Changes

#### ChatPage (`src/pages/ChatPage.js`)
- **Read Receipt Display**: 
  - Single checkmark (✓) - Message sent
  - Double gray checkmarks (✓✓) - Message delivered
  - Double blue checkmarks (✓✓) - Message read
- **Auto Mark as Read**: 
  - Messages automatically marked as read when user opens conversation
  - Uses SignalR `MarkMessagesAsRead` method
- **Real-time Updates**: 
  - Listens to `MessagesRead` and `MessageRead` events
  - Updates read status in real-time

## How It Works

### Sending Messages
1. User sends a message
2. Message saved with `IsDelivered = false`, `IsRead = false`
3. If receiver is online, message immediately marked as delivered
4. Sender sees single checkmark (sent)

### Receiving Messages
1. Receiver receives message via SignalR
2. Message displayed with delivery confirmation
3. When receiver opens/views conversation:
   - All unread messages from sender marked as read
   - Sender receives notification
   - Sender sees blue double checkmarks

### Read Status Icons
- ✓ (Single gray checkmark) - Message sent
- ✓✓ (Double gray checkmarks) - Message delivered to recipient
- ✓✓ (Double blue checkmarks) - Message read by recipient

## Database Migration

To apply the database changes, run the following SQL script on your database:

```bash
# Navigate to the backend folder
cd ../../depo_diplom/Experience-master/ExperienceProject

# Run the migration script (update database name)
sqlcmd -S your_server -d experience_sharing_db -i ADD_READ_RECEIPTS_MIGRATION.sql
```

Or manually execute the SQL in SSMS:
1. Open SQL Server Management Studio
2. Connect to your database
3. Open `ADD_READ_RECEIPTS_MIGRATION.sql`
4. Execute the script

## Testing

### Test Scenarios
1. **Send message to online user**:
   - Send message
   - Should immediately show double gray checkmarks (delivered)
   
2. **Recipient opens chat**:
   - Sender should see blue double checkmarks (read)
   
3. **Send message to offline user**:
   - Send message
   - Should show single checkmark (sent)
   - When user comes online, should update to delivered

4. **Multiple messages**:
   - Send multiple messages
   - All should be marked as read when recipient opens chat

## Notes
- Read receipts only apply to messages you sent
- Receipt status updates in real-time via SignalR
- Database migration required before deploying
- Existing messages will be marked as delivered after migration
