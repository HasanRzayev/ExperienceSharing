2. Share modal opens with all share options
3. User selects "Send to Contacts"
4. Followers modal opens showing all contacts
5. User selects one or more contacts
6. User clicks "Send"
7. For each selected contact:
   - Creates a message via API
   - Message type: `experience_share`
   - Message content: Title, description, and link
8. Messages are delivered via SignalR
9. Recipients see the experience link in their chat
10. Recipients can click the link to view the experience

### Message Click Flow:
1. User opens Messages page
2. User sees shared experience in conversation
3. Message has visual indicators (cursor, hover effect)
4. User clicks on the message
5. `handleMessageClick` function is called
6. Function extracts experience ID from URL
7. Navigates to `/card/:id`
8. Detail page displays the experience
